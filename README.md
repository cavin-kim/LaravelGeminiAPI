Gemini API Integration in Laravel
Overview
This guide walks you through integrating the Gemini API into a Laravel application. It includes setting up your environment, creating necessary components, and accessing API data.

Prerequisites
A running Laravel application
Gemini API key
Basic understanding of Laravel and Composer
Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the provided URL.

2. Install Dependencies
Use Composer to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create .env File: If a .env file does not exist, create it from the .env.example file.
Add API Key: Open the .env file and add your Gemini API key. Ensure you follow the format specified in the .env file.
4. Generate Application Key
Run the command to generate the Laravel application key if it has not been set up already.

5. Create the Controller
Create a new controller to handle interactions with the Gemini API. Define methods within this controller to perform API requests and process responses.

6. Define Routes
Add routes in the routes/web.php file to connect your application to the newly created controller methods. Ensure these routes correspond to the actions you want to perform with the Gemini API.

7. Create the View
Create a view file in the resources/views directory to display the data retrieved from the Gemini API. Format the view to present the information clearly and effectively.

8. Run Your Application
Start the Laravel development server and navigate to the designated route in your web browser to view the data retrieved from the Gemini API.

Troubleshooting
API Key Issues: Ensure the API key is correctly set in the .env file and is valid.
Permission Denied: Confirm that your API key has the required permissions for the API endpoints.
Network Issues: Check your network connection and the availability of the Gemini API endpoint.
