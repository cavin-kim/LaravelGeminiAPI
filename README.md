Gemini API Integration in Laravel
Overview
This guide walks you through integrating the Gemini API into a Laravel application. It covers setting up your environment, creating necessary components, and accessing API data.

Prerequisites
A running Laravel application
Gemini API key
Basic understanding of Laravel and Composer

Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the provided URL.
git clone <https://github.com/cavin-kim/LaravelGeminiAPI.git>

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to your project directory and use Composer to install the necessary dependencies.
cd /path/to/your/project
composer install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create .env File: If a .env file does not exist, create it from the .env.example file.
cp .env.example .env
Add API Key: Open the .env file and add your Gemini API key. Follow the format specified in the .env file.

4. Generate Application Key
Generate the Laravel application key if it has not been set up already.

php artisan key:generate
5. Configure Routes
Ensure that routes in routes/web.php are properly set up to connect your application to the existing controller methods that handle Gemini API interactions.

6. Verify Views
Check the view files in the resources/views directory to ensure they correctly display the data retrieved from the Gemini API. Make sure the views are formatted to present the information clearly and effectively.

7. Run Your Application
Start the Laravel development server and navigate to the designated route in your web browser to view the data retrieved from the Gemini API.


php artisan serve
Troubleshooting
API Key Issues: Ensure the API key is correctly set in the .env file and is valid.
Permission Denied: Confirm that your API key has the required permissions for the API endpoints.
Network Issues: Check your network connection and the availability of the Gemini API endpoint.
